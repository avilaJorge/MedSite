                            His research interests are focused on computational science, high performance computing (HPC), and Science Gateways. Science Gateways enable entire communities of researchers associated with a common discipline to use HPC and cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources through a common interface that is configured for optimal use. One of his NSF funded projects is the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) which facilitates easy and seamless access to and use of HPC and CI resources for the neuroscience community for large scale simulations and data processing. He has been involved in research applying traditional HPC resources and Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) for radiation therapy, SPECT imaging, and Monte Carlo simulations in collaboration with researchers from radiation oncology, radiology, and neurosciences.

                            One of his recent research interests is to bring HPC and CI to the biomedical community to enable computational and data focused biomedical and clinical research. He is also interested in convergence of HPC and data. He has developed parallel algorithms for various kinds of HPC machines and is interested in understanding the performance and scalability of scientific applications on HPC machines. He is PI of multiple research projects funded by NSF, DOD, AFOSR and industries such as Intel, Microsoft, Engility Corporation.
