                            Dr. Moore is the Deputy Director of the Medical Physics Division and Associate Director of Research. Dr. Moore is a pioneer in the nascent field of knowledge-based planning. Knowledge-based planning involves applying prior knowledge from large datasets of previously treated patients in order to optimize treatment planning of new patients, significantly improving plan quality and efficiency. He is currently engaged in both the development of new knowledge-based dose prediction methods as well as the clinical implementation of knowledge-based radiotherapy treatment planning across the UC San Diego enterprise

                            Dr. Moore has successfully applied this approach to a wide variety of radiotherapy treatment sites, including head-and-neck, prostate, gynecologic, brain, lung, pancreas, bone, anorectal, and liver cancers. He has published 40 peer-reviewed papers and book chapters, and is lead inventor on two patents regarding knowledge-based dosimetric prediction. His other research interests are focused on the expansion of data-driven methods in radiotherapy, particularly creating efficient decision support systems and the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) to automate error-prone and inefficient clinical processes
