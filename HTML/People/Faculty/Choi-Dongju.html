                        <div>
                            He has broad experience and interest in computational aspects of natural science (weather calculation, parallel algorithm development on earthquake simulation, earth electro-magnetic analysis), medicine (brain tumor simulation using finite element method and physical simulation for tumor diagnose and treatment with radiation technology) and engineering (acoustics, combustion, material and stress analysis, and environmental hydrology) using cutting-edge supercomputing resources ranged from large distributed memory systems to the systems with computational accelerators.

                        <div>
                            He started to get participated in medical physics area with sincere enthusiasm to apply the above broad experience and interest to the critical development in this area. He immediately tarted to adapt NVIDIA GPU systems to accelerate computation in existing medical physics for tumor diagnosing and treatment with highly optimized processes. The medical physics team in the division has been well recognized in the research and clinical community of this area for the pioneering work. The contribution to the medical community of this effort was often exampled as one of the most disruptive technology in the medical physics society at the current age not to mention of significant improvements in the clinical application.

                            He not only continues to put his desire in improving medical physics research with fast evolving computational algorithm and hardware, but also tries to infuse deep-learning algorithm into the work. Leveraged with the proven big data resource and techniques in many fields, he believes that the research involving this technique in the medical physics is the right paradigm and should be focused with sincere efforts to put the improved technology to enhance the technology of cancer diagnose and treatment in the near future.
