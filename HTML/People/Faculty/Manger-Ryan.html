                            After completing his PhD, Dr. Manger worked for 3 years as a Radiological Engineer at the Center for Radiation Protection Knowledge in Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). At ORNL, he consulted on projects for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Energy (DOE). His efforts as a corresponding member of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) included Monte Carlo dose calculation and biokinetic modeling.
