                            Dr. Hoffman is a faculty medical physicist, who clinically focuses on breast radiation therapy. He has experience implementing conventional external beam breast treatment strategies, and novel approaches, including deep inspiration breath hold for VMAT and electron beams. Dr. Hoffman also has experience implementing optical surface tracking technology, to improved accuracy and reproducibility during breast and other treatments. Additionally, he currently runs the intra-operative radiation therapy program for partial breast treatment during surgery.
