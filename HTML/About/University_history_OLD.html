<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of California (UC)
    <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu</a> was chartered in 1868. As a whole, the UC is one of the largest Universities in the world consisting of
    <img align="left" alt="UC Campus Map.png" src="/playground/radiation-medicine/about/PublishingImages/UC%20Campus%20Map.png" style="margin: 5px; width: 249px;"/> over 7,000 faculty members, 160,000 students and employs approximately 121,000 faculty, staff and academics statewide. The UC system is currently comprised of 10 separate campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. In 2014, there were over 183,000 student applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UC is affiliated with the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and the Los Alamos Facility. Each campus boasts a unique environment, and a variety of achievements, honors and academic disciplines. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 6 medical centers in the UC system: Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.&#160; A medical center in Riverside is the most recent addition in 2013. The UC Medical Centers support the clinical teaching programs of the medical and health sciences schools and receive more than 138,000 inpatient discharges, 261,000 emergency room visits and more than 3.6 million outpatient visits per year.&#160; Collectively, these centers comprise the largest health care system in California. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UC San Diego
    <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">http://www.ucsd.edu/</a>&#160; occupies 1200 acres along the Pacific coast in La Jolla, California.&#160; One of the premiere campuses of the UC system, UC San Diego is also one of the youngest (founded in 1960).&#160; The first graduate student was admitted in 1960 and the first undergraduate in 1964. UC San Diego is thus one of the youngest major Universities in the United States. </p>

Roger Tsien PhD, a member of the UCSD Cancer Center and collaborator with Dr. Sunil Advani, was the most recent Nobel Laureate receiving his Prize in Chemistry in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UC San Diego is affiliated with several prestigious research neighbors, including the Salk Institute
    <a href="http://www.salk.edu/">http://www.salk.edu/</a>, the Burnham Institute

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several other facilities are located on the UC San Diego campus adjacent to the Medical Center in La Jolla. These include several research facilities where many cancer center researchers have labs. In addition, a new 300,000 square foot Clinical and Translational Research Institute is currently under construction and set to open in Spring 2016. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <img align="right" alt="CTRI pic.png" src="/playground/radiation-medicine/about/PublishingImages/CTRI%20pic.png" style="margin: 5px; width: 318px;"/>Other new building projects include the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine and the new Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center. Brachy-<span style="line-height: 1.6;">therapy (eye plaques) is commonly performed for choroidal melanoma in the Shiley Eye Institute adjacent to the Cancer Center.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UC San Diego is set to break ground in Spring 2016 for the new Center for Novel Therapeutics adjacent to the Moores Cancer Center (see below). Effectively a basic science extension of the Cancer Center, approximately one-half of the building will be occupied by local biotech companies that work closely with the UC San Diego&#160;Cancer Center.</p>
