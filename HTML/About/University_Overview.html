                                    The <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/">University of California (UC)</a> was chartered in 1868. As a whole, it is one of the largest Universities in the world consisting of over 7,000 faculty members, 160,000 students and employs approximately 121,000 faculty, staff and academics statewide.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The UC system is currently comprised of 10 separate campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. In 2014, there were over 183,000 student applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Affiliated with the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and the Los Alamos Facility, each campus boasts a unique environment, and a variety of achievements, honors and academic disciplines.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are currently 6 medical centers in the UC system: Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. A medical center in Riverside is the most recent addition in 2013. The UC Medical Centers support the clinical teaching programs of the medical and health sciences schools and receive more than 138,000 inpatient discharges, 261,000 emergency room visits and more than 3.6 million outpatient visits per year. Collectively, these centers comprise the largest health care system in California.

                                    <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a> occupies 1200 acres along the Pacific coast in La Jolla, California. One of the premiere campuses of the UC system, UC San Diego is also one of the youngest (founded in 1960). The first graduate student was admitted in 1960 and the first undergraduate in 1964. UC San Diego is thus one of the youngest major Universities in the United States.

                                    Since its beginnings, the focus of UC San Diego has been on science and engineering and over its short history 18 faculty members have awarded Nobel Prizes, including 3 in Medicine and Physiology: George Palade (1974), Renata Dulbecco (1975) and Sydney Brenner (2002). Roger Tsien PhD was the most recent Nobel Laureate receiving his Prize in Chemistry in 2009.

                                    In recent years, UC San Diego has received multiple prestigious awards. In 2012, Department of Bioengineering Professor (and Cancer Center member) Shu Chien PhD was awarded the National Medal of Science from President Obama. His research has led to improved testing and treatment of atherosclerosis. The prior year, Chancellor Marye Ann Fox, also received a National Medal of Science award, making UC San Diego the first University ever to receive back-to-back National Medals of Science.

                                    Several years in a row, UC San Diego has even been named a Top-Ranked "Surf" University in the country. This recognition was based not only on its proximity to world-class beaches and surfing but also to its commitment to the "academics" of surfing. The Department of Physics offers a well-attended Physics of Surfing Class.

Dr. Brenner oversees the Medical Center, the Clinical and Basic Science Departments, the UC San Diego Medical School and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy. The School of Medicine currently enrolls 120 students per year and is consistently ranked among the top American Medical Schools by the U.S. News World Report. Despite its short history, the UC San Diego School of Medicine is consistently ranked among the Top 15 Research Medical Schools and the Top 15 NIH funded Medical Schools in the country.
