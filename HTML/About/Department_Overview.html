                                <p> The Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences (RMAS) was founded in 2006 with the recruitment of Dr. Arno J. Mundt from the University of Chicago, an internationally-recognized academic radiation oncologist and educator, as the founding Chair. Prior to 2006, Radiation Oncology was a small Division within the Department of Radiology with a limited clinic in the basement of the Hillcrest Medical Center. </p>
                                <p> Initially known as the Department of Radiation Oncology, the Department quickly entered a phase of rapid growth and expansion of its faculty, patient volumes, treatment facilities and personnel. In 2010, the Department was renamed the Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences (RMAS), reflecting its dual roles as a clinical and research Department. At that time, it transitioned from a Hospital Department to a full Department with the UC San Diego School of Medicine. </p>
                                <p> Today, the RMAS Department is the predominant provider of Radiation Oncology services in the region with over 5000 new patients seen annually, expanded facilities in La Jolla and throughout the San Diego region, and a faculty of over 60 members recruited from prestigious academic centers throughout the country. It is home to two growing residency training programs in Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics, as well as the new Center for Translational Medicine and Imaging located in the Altman Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute (CTRI) on the La Jolla campus. </p>

                                <p> The RMAS Department is comprised of 3 Divisions: Clinical Radiation Oncology (CRO), Clinical &amp; Translational Research (CTR), and Medical Physics &amp; Technology (MPT). Together with the Department Chair, the 3 Divisions Directors form the Chair &amp; Division Director’s Committee, the Executive Governing Body of the Department. To increase the diversity and number of faculty involved in the governance of the Department, the RMAS Council was established in 2016 as an Advisory Board to the Chair. It is comprised of the Vice-Chairs, Assistant Vice-Chairs, Division Directors and two annually elected junior faculty. In total, there are 3 Vice-Chairs (Strategy &amp; Business Development, Administration &amp; Finance and Medical Physics &amp; Technology) and 4 Assistant Vice-Chairs (Education, Clinical, VA Affairs and Diversity). </p>

                                    The Department has a strong commitment to Education and Training, offering programs ranging from Clinical Rotations for Medical Students to Training Programs for the practicing clinicians. UCSD has two accredited Residency Programs, in Radiation Oncology and in Medical Physics. The Radiation Oncology Residency was launched in 2010 with 1 resident per year (4 total residents). However, the program was quickly enlarged to 2 residents/year (8 total) in 2012 and, most recently, to 3 residents/year (12 total) in 2014, making UCSD larger than the majority of programs in the country. The Medical Physics residency was launched in 2007 with 1 resident/year (2 total) and increased to 2 residents/year (4 total) in 2016.

                                    Both Residency Programs offer novel didactics including lectures focused on the Business of Radiation Oncology, Boards Reviews and Medical Spanish for the Radiation Oncologist. Each rotation is followed by written and oral examinations preparing the resident for their Boards Exams. Both programs offer residents the opportunity to rotate internationally (recent residents have opted for rotations in Thailand, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Italy). The Radiation Oncology residency is one of the few in the country to ensure a full year of protected research. Both programs have enjoyed a high degree of success in job placements, both in academia (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, UT Southwestern, Vanderbilt, University of Utah, University of Maryland, among others).
