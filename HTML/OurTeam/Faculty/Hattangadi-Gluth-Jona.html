                            Her research focuses on the use of advanced magnetic imaging (MRI) techniques in radiation therapy planning and measuring response to radiation in brain tissue. A recipient of a prestigious NIH R-01 Grant evaluating image-guided cognitive-sparing radiosurgery, she is the principal investigator on several investigator-initiated clinical trials, including a longitudinal study of advanced diffusion imaging and serial neurocognitive testing to measure radiation-induced injury in brain tumor patients. In addition to her imaging research, she is also active in Health Outcomes research and has published studies on a wide range of topics including medical device recalls, industry payments to physicians and medical malpractice claims, which have appeared in many prestigious journals including the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).
