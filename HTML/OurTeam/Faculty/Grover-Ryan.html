                                Following the completion of his residency training at Loma Linda University, he joined the Loma Linda Radiation Oncology Department, the site of the first hospital-based proton center in the country.  He thus has considerable experience in the use of proton therapy for benign and malignant disease.  He was recruited to San Diego in 2014 with the opening of the Proton Therapy Center (now named the California Proton Therapy Center).  He is the author of multiple proton therapy publications including journal articles and book chapters.  He joined the RMAS faculty in 2016.
