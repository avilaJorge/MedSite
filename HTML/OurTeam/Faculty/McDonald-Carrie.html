                            Dr. McDonaldâ€™s research program utilizes a variety of non-invasive imaging techniques to further the understanding of neuropsychological deficits in brain tumor patients. Together with researchers from the Departments of Radiology and Neurosciences, she is evaluating a novel advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging approach, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), to improve tumor detection and response to therapy in patients with high-grade gliomas. She has published over 60 journal articles and reviews, which have been published in highly respected journals including Neuro-Oncology, Epilepsy Research and Neurology.
