                            Dr. Iain Macewan is an Associate Professor and RMAS Pediatric Oncology Section Chief.  He oversees the radiotherapeutic treatment of all pediatric cancers at both the Moores Cancer Center and the California Proton Center, an Affiliate of the UC San Diego Health Cancer Network.

                        <p>
                            Trained at the first hospital-based Proton Center in the United States, Dr. MacEwan has considerable experience applying proton therapy in patients with cancer, particularly in a wide range of pediatric malignancies including Medulloblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, etc. In his role of Pediatric Oncology Section Chief, he works closely with pediatric oncologists and surgeons at Rady Children’s Hospital. He also oversees proton therapy treatment for adult patients with Gastrointestinal Tumors, including rectal and anal cancers.  Dr. Macewan also has a clinic at our 4S Ranch Treatment Center where he sees adult patients with a variety of malignancies.

                        <p>
                            Dr. Macewan is committed to advancing the care of children undergoing radiotherapy.  He helped develop a novel proton therapy approach in children with medulloblastoma to reduce dose to their spine bone (vertebrae) thereby reducing the risk of bone growth abnormalities, an approach that is receiving increasing attention in the pediatric oncology community.  He also is active in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the premier pediatric cancer consortium in the world.
