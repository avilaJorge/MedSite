                <p>March is the month that resident applicants in both Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics participate in nationwide Residency Matches.  After a long season of applications and interviews, rank lists are submitted and applicants find out where in the country they will be living and working.  It’s an exciting day for the applicants and the programs.  We are extremely pleased by the 2019 Residency Match results for both of our programs!  From left to right below, our 5 new residents (3 Medical and 2 Physics) are:
                    <strong>Asona Lui MD PhD</strong> (U Kansas),
                    <strong>Kripa Guram MD</strong> (U Iowa),

                <p> On May 1<sup>st</sup> 2019, the California Proton Center officially became part of the
                    <em>UC San Diego Health Cancer Network</em>.  This is a culmination of many months of work by many individuals and represents an important milestone for the Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences.  Over the last year, we have sought to work closer with the California Proton Center and integrate our services and programs for patients with a wide range of malignancies. A major goal has been optimizing clinical operations and treatment planning as well as the establishment of clinical trials. </p>
