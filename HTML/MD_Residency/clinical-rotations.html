                <p>Clinical rotations are arranged on a 3-month block schedule. Each rotation pairs the resident with one (rarely two) attending who has a team including a designated nurse and an administrative assistant. Each attending has a primary disease-site concentration, but may see a small number of patients with other types of cancer as well. Residents focus their reading and clinical learning, as well as their end of rotation oral exam, on the designated disease-site. </p>
                <p>Resident activities include attending Tumor Boards, reviewing medical records and ensuring the proper work-up has been completed, deciding on the plan for treatment with the patient, and prescribing radiation.</p>
                <p>Starting the first day of residency, the resident is involved in treatment planning, from ensuring proper simulation, to contouring, and reviewing radiation plans. Residents work with the attending to provide continuity of care for their patients throughout treatment and follow-up.</p>
