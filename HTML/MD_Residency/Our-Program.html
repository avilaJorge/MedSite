                        <p>I am especially proud of our exceptional didactic program comprised of a wide range of lectures and conferences based on a disease month system, ensuring that residents receive an in depth exposure to all disease sites. In addition, the didactic program includes a wide range of specialized topics include classes on such topics as the Business of Radiation Oncology and Professionalism & Leadership, among others.</p>
                        <p>
                            Another unique feature of our program is an international elective during the PGY5 year that allows residents to spend a month doing clinical radiation oncology at a location of their choice. We encourage them to make this an international elective to a developing country for a unique experience and perspective on radiation therapy.
